    Model of a Segment, which is a component between
    two Joints of a RobotArm.
    A Segment has one input and one output attachemt,
    defining the direction from the RobotBase to the tool

    A Segment has a Mechanics.RigidBody attribute, body, which
    define it's degrees of freedom.
    The Segment may have an ExternalReference, which ref.
    to a RigidBody in an external scene description,
    defined in the external model imported by
    the externalFilePath of the Robot of consern.

    The Segment can be assigned a collisionGeometry,
    which will automatically be part of the body.
