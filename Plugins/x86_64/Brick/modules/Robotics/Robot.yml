    The Brick.Physics.Robotics.Robot model is built up by
    one robot base and one or more robot arms.

    It is possible to interpret an external component
    (see Physics.Component) as a robot.
    To do this a segment can be created on Robot level
    (otherwise segments are at RobotArm level)
    with an externalReference to the Name or unique ID
    if the rigid body or connector/constraint that is
    wanted to be interpreted as a segment or joint.

    The Robot module will try following a linear structure
    starting from the external rigid body or connector
    to build an arm. If the structure is branching
    it is assumed the arm ends.
    It is possible to declare several external segments/joints,
    they will join in the same external arm.
