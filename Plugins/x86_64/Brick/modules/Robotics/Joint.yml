Joint:
  .doc: >
    A Joint is connecting two Segments.
    Segment1 and Segment2

    Each joint need a reference to an AttachmentPairConnector,
    which will be responsible for the positioning of the Segments.

    Segment1 and Segment2 in their turn
    need references to the attachments of the Connector.

    A Joint has a position attribute,
    which define it's position during positioning.

    The Joint may have an ExternalReference, which ref.
    to an AttachmentPairConnector in an external scene description,
    defined in the external model imported by
    the externalFilePath of the Robot of consern.



  externalReference:
    .doc: >
      A reference to some external instance that can
      be used to fully or partly populate the Joint attributes.
      The external attributes, such as motorFriction,
      can be overriden in the Joint declaration.
