  .doc: Sets the desired normalized angle of a motor/servo as a value between -1 and 1.
    What these values corresponds to are specified by the minAngle and maxAngle attributes
    respectively. The speed with which the motor will try to reach its goal is defined by the
    motor interaction (AngleRotationalMotorInteraction1D).
