AttachmentPairRange:
  .doc: >
          A scalar range defining a valid range for one degree of freedom.
          The degree of freedom is by dafault related to the tangential direction.

  connectOrder:
    .doc: >
            Positive ( > 0 ) value moves body of attachment2 to body of attachment1,
            negative value vice versa. 0 will have to investigate order according to constrained degrees o freedom.
            All affected dof's has to be constrained of the body not moved, for the connect to happen.
