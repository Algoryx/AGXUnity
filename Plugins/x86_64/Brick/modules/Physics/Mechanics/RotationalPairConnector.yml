RotationalPairConnector:
  .extends: Physics.Mechanics.AttachmentPairConnector

  .doc: >
     A connector that can identify already used attachments that does not constraint
     the rotational dofs for a body or node of the two involved attachments.
     This to rotate a node around its rotational axis to achieve the wanted positioning of its attachments.
     It may also rotate two nodes, to  achieve the positioning.
  angle:
    .type: Real
    .doc: >
      Angle in degrees between the normal vectors of the HingeAttachments.
      If null, no angle is set, and the rotational degree of freedom is still there.
      If it is set, the hinge connector sets all degrees of freedom.
      Default value is zero, meaning the hinge connector will be considered positioning all dofs.
    .value: 0

  angleConstrainDof:
    .doc: >
      If true, the positioning algorithm will consider the angle to be constrained.
      If false, the variable is set, but is still free to change during positioning.

  validAngleRange:

      A range used for declaring valid angles when positioning, not to be confuced with an interaction.
