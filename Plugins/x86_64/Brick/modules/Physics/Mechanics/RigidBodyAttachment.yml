  .extends: Physics.Charge
  .doc: >
    The purpose of a RigidBodyAttachment (RBA) is to define a local coordinate system
    for a RigidBody to align and interact with other RigidBodies.


  referenceTangent:
    .doc: >
        Primary direction for attachment frame.
        Defined in body coordinates.
        Named Tangent since it's primary function is to tangent a constraint surface.
    .type: Vec3
    .value: Vec3(0,0,1)

  referenceNormal:
    .doc: >
        Secondary direction for attachment frame.
        Defined in body coordinates.
        Named Normal since it must be orthogonal to the Tangent.
    .type: Vec3
    .value: Vec3(1,0,0)
