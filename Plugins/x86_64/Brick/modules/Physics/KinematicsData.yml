      The declared linear velocity is seen as an
      initial state. The runtime variable can be updated
      but the initial velocity is reused if the owning body
      is part of a Physics.Component is that is rebuilt
      in a new batch configuration.

      The declared angular velocity is seen as an
      initial state. The runtime variable can be updated
      but the initial velocity is reused if the owning body
      is part of a Physics.Component is that is rebuilt
      in a new batch configuration.
